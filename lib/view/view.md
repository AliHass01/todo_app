# Usage

> This folder contains all visual elements

## New feature
In this directory every feature gets a folder, where all code is stored.
So if you want to add your own feature, create a new folder with precise title inside this `app`-Folder.

## New reusable code
If you want to create a reusable widget, which is intended to be used in other screens or boilerplate logic, put that into the common folder.
